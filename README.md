# hello-world
This project is going to be linked to Code First: Girls course. I would like to work on something 'philosophical' but I need some inspiration right now.
I am basically a knowledge-seeker. I am quite a typical person, I guess there is not much to say about me. I work as waitress in order to get money for following my true passion, which is philosophy, and which my family suggests me not to. As philosophy student, I have got this forma mentis, this mindset (or maybe it is because of this mindset itself that I ended up studying and loving philosophy) which brings me always to question the reasons why things happen in my life. I always try to find the truth, in whatever people say or however people act. It is a dangerous habit indeed, to try to read through others. Sometimes I succeed easily, sometimes I find myself struggling with what my rationality and my instinct say (which, most of the times, diverge).
